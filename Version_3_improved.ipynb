    "In the lecture we have learned particle filtering. which can be interpreted as Monte Carlo method for Hidden Markov Models. In this exercise, we learn how to use this method to track a moving robot's position overtime. Basically, we have access to the steering and velocity control inputs. We also have sensors that measures distance to visible landmarks. Then the basic idea is that the population of particles tracks the high-likelihood regions of the robot's position.\n",
